      <h2 class="left">CROmetrics Paid Acquisition Leader Job Application</h2>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="container">
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-12 center" style="text-align:left">
						<h2 class="center">Welcome, a little bit about the job</h2>
						<p>CROmetrics started out focusing on Conversion Rate Optimization, hence the CROmetrics name.  However, we have always worked on optimizing traffic from paid sources, and found that when we optimize that traffic, we can often get a 30-50% reduction in cost of acqusition, and we have seen up to 90% when the on-site experience is particularly broken.  To date we have partnered with external firms when our clients needed SEM help.  However, we have found that coordinating the teams has been somewhat difficult, and we think it's best to have the paid acquisition skillset in-house.  To that end, we are looking for a leader to build the team around.  We already have clients, and it's clear there is a large market for this service, so what is important is that we find someone who can start out doing the work, but can quickly transition into leading the team, and has the skillset to be able to close new sales.  We think the right profile is likely someone with agency experience or in-house client experience that is looking to level up.  Because we have a distributed team, someone who is either looking to move away from a major metro area such as San Francisco or New York or doesn't live in one of these areas is generally a good fit for us since we're able to provide a great job that is typically available in these markets, but without having the high cost of living and other things associated with living in these markets.<br/>

				<br/>
		<h2 class="center">A little bit about our hiring process</h2>
		<p>We're glad you're interested in working with us.  We have a fairly unusual hiring process, but it has proven to work well for both us and people who are interested in working for us.  We have found that demonstrating basic competency is the best predictor of initial qualification for working with us, followed by actual work. Our process reflects that: below, we outline what our values are and how we work, and then ask you to complete a small task.  <br/>

<br/>

Assuming we like your response, we will hire you for a “paid interview” where you start working with us for a small number of hours each week.  If we both like working together, we expand the relationship, if not, then both sides “won” in the deal.<br><br>If you have questions as you go through this make notes and if we haven't answered them by the end feel free to email us at <a href="mailto:chris@crometrics.com">chris@crometrics.com</a>.<br/>

<br>This essay sums up the philosophy we operate by: <a href="http://www.nato.int/nrdc-it/about/message_to_garcia.pdf">A Message to Garcia</a><i> </i>(Right click to open in a new window.) Please read this short essay. If you are able and willing to work this way please continue.<br><br>If you're interested you can <a href="http://www.crometrics.com/whoweare.html">learn more about us</a>.

<h2 class="center">Our  Main Internal Tools: Trello and Slack</h2>

We currently use <a href="https://trello.com/">Trello</a> to manage our testing process. We'll send you an invite to Trello and assign you your first test through it. <br><br>We use <a href="https://slack.com/is/team-communication">Slack</a> as an internal messaging tool. <br/>

<br/>

We also use Google apps and docs, and Quip for training and internal documentation.<br><br>We do encourage you to watch Trello's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7najSDZcn-U ">training video</a> to understand how this tool works. Both Trello and Slack have great walkthroughs after you signup.<br/>

<br/>

<h2 class="center">Please Complete the Following Project</h2>

This is a typical task you would be doing for us.  It will help us get a sense of how you think and work with paid digital marketing.  Please spend between 30 minutes and 1 hour on this project. If it looks like you did much more than that, that will hurt your chances of getting the job.<br/><br>

<div><ul><li>Go to <a href="http://NationalBankcard.com">http://NationalBankcard.com</a></a>. Start a new document in whatever your favorite way to share information like this is, eg Google Docs.

<br/></li><li>Define the goals of the website.

<br/></li><li>Who is its target audience?

<br/></li><li>Design either a quick AdWords campaign or a Facebook campaign for the website to complete one of the goals you outlined in 2.  If AdWords, type in the elements of the campaign (keywords, ads, targeting, etc.). If Facebook, screenshot your campaign as designed in the FB interface. 

<br/></li></ul></div><h2 class="center">How we work</h2>

<div data-section-style='5'><ul><li>We use Harvest to track contractor time. <i>All time must be tracked since that is how we pay you.</i>

<br/></li><li><b>We pay within 7 days</b> after the end of the month in which the work is done. This makes it simple for you - just sum up the time in worksnaps and multiply by hourly rate, and we will pay you within 7 days. Additionally our promise is 7 days, but most of the time we pay same day.

<br/></li>
<li><b>Ask questions</b>. We prefer you try to problem solve yourself, but there are times when you simply can't find the answer you need. If you're not sure about a test or anything else, do your best to solve the problem. Then let us know your quandary and how you approached it. If it needs updated we'll let you know.

<br/></li></ul></div><br/>

<h2 class="center">Let us know you've read this page.</h2>

When you've finished reading this page and understand how we work, please create an email to <a href="mailto:chris@crometrics.com">chris@crometrics.com</a>, <a href="mailto:brian@crometrics.com">brian@crometrics.com</a>, and <a href="mailto:tom@crometrics.com">tom@crometrics.com</a>. <br><br>Once you have read and completed the above steps, and sent the email as directed above with the deliverables from your small project, we'll hire you and assign you a trial task to see how it goes.<br/>
