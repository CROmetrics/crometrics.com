<h1 id='KPIACAcN1ZM'>Senior Growth Product Manager Job Application</h1>

This is for a consulting position where you will be hired as a full-time or part-time contractor with complete flexibility over your schedule, and the ability to work from home or anywhere in the world.<br/>

<br/>

<h2 id='KPIACARtqw9'>Getting Started</h2>

Thank you for your interest in the Growth Sr. Product Manager position. <br><br>To apply for this position, please follow the instructions below. Completing these steps is part of the application process. This not only helps us screen for serious candidates, but it also serves as an education tool to help you understand the type of work you'll be doing with CROmetrics.<br><br>If you have questions as you go through this, please make notes and feel free to email <a href="mailto:chris@crometrics.com">chris@crometrics.com</a> at any time.<br><br>This essay sums up the philosophy we operate by: <a href="http://www.nato.int/nrdc-it/about/message_to_garcia.pdf">A Message to Garcia</a><i> </i>(Right click to open in a new window.) Please read this short essay. If you are able and willing to work this way please continue.<br><br>We are a distributed team, with the founder/principal located in the San Francisco Bay Area. The distributed team allows us to hire the best people regardless of where they live. Often this leads to people who either can't or don't want to go to an office - people with young children who want to be able to leave in the middle of the day for an hour to volunteer at school or be there if they are sick, digital nomads, people who don't live near big city type jobs, etc. For the product management position, you need to be able to run screensharing video conferences with clients, and be able to be responsive to client needs during US business hours, so that requires that you have a reliable internet connection and be able to mostly work during US business hours. If you're interested you can <a href="http://www.crometrics.com/whoweare.html">learn more about CROmetrics </a>.<br/>

<br/>

<h2 id='KPIACA1D5g9'>Create an ideas/hypotheses backlog</h2>

Our Product Managers partner with our clients to brainstorm great ideas for how to design elegant product solutions to improve our clients' web or mobile apps. These ideas could include anything from improving the messaging on the client's website to appeal to their target audience, fixing known usability issues, improving site navigation, redesigning product flows or other product/design ideas to increase conversions. <br><br>We want to know how you think about designing elegant product solutions focused around increasing conversions. <br><br>Here is the website for one of our clients: <a href="http://www.hired.com/">Hired.com</a><br><br><a href="http://hired.com/">Hired.com</a> spends a lot of money (e.g. through paid ads) to drive applicants, primarily software engineers, to their site. Their goal is to increase the # of leads/applicants that complete the signup flow and are ready to be hired.<br><br>Your first task is to come up with a hypotheses backlog of at least 6-8 ideas you have for improving conversions for the <a href="http://hired.com/">Hired.com</a> website. An example of a hypotheses/idea:<br>"Adding a video to the Hired website will help job candidates understand how Hired works and therefore increase conversions."<br/>

<br/>

<h2 id='KPIACA1mXUt'>Write a spec for one of your hypotheses</h2>

Once you've developed your hypotheses backlog, choose one of the more complicated ideas that you believe will most likely improve website lead conversions. Go ahead and write the spec for that idea. The spec usually comprises of the user story, acceptance criteria, expected user or page interactions, etc. Optionally, you may also produce a wireframe and/or a visual wireframe to go along with your spec, using any number of UX tools such as Axure, Balsamiq, Invision or even simple pen/paper sketching.<br><br>In a real-life client situation, you'll partner with the client to brainstorm ideas/hypotheses together. You'll also agree on the top ideas/hypotheses to test. You'll then write the spec and/or create the wireframes/designs for the hypothesis to test, and will work with engineering to implement and QA this idea. Once the idea is implemented, you'll run an A/B test to see if your hypothesis was a "winning" variation that performed statistically better than the original. Once the test has run its full test cycle, you will share the results with the client, draw insight from the test, and develop new ideas for testing.<br/>

<br/>

<h2 id='KPIACA5Ez8t'>Submit your application</h2>
